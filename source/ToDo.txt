---FIXED: To check the skins (especially Terminal) for the new implemented features: download/attach, access, etc.

---FIXED: The tabbed edit form not working good in Light skin. Another are not tested as well.

---FIXED: The tabbed edit is not styling properly in Chromium! Check the tricks about flex auto scaling!

On logout, all sessions for this IP are deleted. Should be more relaxed...

---DONE: The attached files must be encrypted in the database in order to not allow them to the file system in original form.


The tabs still working weird, because the absolute positioning.

---DONE: The permLogin for the anon users to work as permRegister in order to allow the forum to close the registration.
